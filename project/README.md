# Portfolio Website

I plan to build a personal/portfolio website. I have quite a number of clips online now through my last internship and the school newspaper and it would be nice to have a website that can aggregate it all. I would also want to include personal work (poetry, academic/research papers, music writing, etc.), and that way it would be the most holistic and comprehensive look into me as a writer.

# Inspirations

I really just browsed the internet for any random portfolio site and I realize that these are all mostly company portfolios (and foreign).

* [This website](https://www.rezo-zero.com/en) is my favorite in terms of design/feel. The floating menu box on the left that expands to take half the page is definitely something that I would my website to have eventually have. The front page has a large photo along with some text which takes up the whole screen, and I think that would be the first thing I would want my site to show. I also like the blocks of color to separate the sections.

* [This website](https://www.wokine.com/) is a bit more interactive (things load as you scroll), which might be something I want to include. This also has the pull out menu to the left, and I think the colored highlighting when you hover over the menu links is cute. I like the fixed bar on top that just says the company name in caps letters. The split screen design is rather pretty as well.

* What I really like about [this website](https://www.werkstatt.fr/en/) is the photo hovering. Each photo is "foggy" but when you hover, all of the color returns and the entire photo is presented. I think the photo moving along with how you scroll is a feature that grew on me because it adds nice movement to the site. Also, I feel like it's relatively common. That being said, I also like when photos darken and then show text like in the first website listed.

# Layout

### Front page:
* Fixed menu box on the left middle of the screen
* Background: something pretty
* Center text: "Hi, I'm Janice. I'm an aspiring journalist currently attending NYU." plus a short bio

### Menu:
* When the menu box is clicked, the full menu will appear and take up half of the screen
* Links will include clips, poetry, academics, music, contact (eventually)
* On the bottom, links to Twitter, Linkedin, and Spotify

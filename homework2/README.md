#### General thoughts

This was my first Wes Anderson movie! I thought I'd write some thoughts. I don't have anything bad or too critical to say. I watched it on my flight home and I don't think I really had any expectations since I decided to watch it on a whim. Maybe that worked in the movie's favor, but I really enjoyed it.

I was rather surprised by how... optimistic it became. Judging solely from Wes Anderson's cinematic style, which is recognizable in an instant, I would think that every movie of his would have some depressing, ulterior motive. Like how **edgy** movies go. I know that's unfounded-- like _Moonrise Kingdom_ looks happy at first glance (whether it actually is, I'm not sure)-- but _Isle of Dogs_ was thought provoking but not creepy or hopeless. Basically, it's a lot warmer than I initially thought it would be.

#### Stop motion

I'm a sucker for animated films. Not only do they tend to feel more accessible, but it's also such effortful, beautiful... ***art***. Especially when it's stop motion? I'm just reminded of that one scene from _Parks & Recreation_ when Ben takes a break from working life and creates "Requiem for a Tuesday." He sunk a whole day into this stop motion project but only got two seconds and he literally has an existential crisis from how little he managed to accomplish.

If real stop motion is anything like that (which it must be), then the amount of manpower and creativity required for a full-fledged movie must be insane. And for a movie as visually dense as _Isle of Dogs_... It just fosters respect in you, to be honest.

#### Asian representation done RIGHT

I'm wary when white people try their hand at something Asian. Not that they're not allowed to, but it's so common to see it done **so** incorrectly. Like egregiously so.

But I'd like to say that _Isle of Dogs_ portrayed Japanese culture respectfully. One of the main writers was Japanese, and that same person had a role in choosing casting, so the fact that an Asian person was involved in the very inception of the film is encouraging and _right_, to say the least.

The film itself maintains a really cool dichotomy between the dogs and the humans. Humans, unless they spoke English, all spoke Japanese (meaning Japanese voice actors!) while the dogs spoke English. There's a disclaimer at the beginning that says something like, "All dog barks have been rendered into English." If I'm remembering correctly, no Japanese is unnaturally translated, meaning that unless an English translator within the film is diegetically translating or there's a built in visual representation like a speech monitor, then you won't know what exactly the characters are saying. (Which is why the visuals are so important too.) It maintains a lot of realism in this sense-- Japanese people in Japan speak Japanese and people and dogs don't speak the same language.

It's refreshing.

#### Appreciation for the movie

* Atari is a 12 year old badass
* Tracy's passion is inspiring
* Old hierarchies and traditions need to be challenged. Activism is a very much needed fixture of society lol
* Chief's sentimental arc was very sweet
* The assistant scientist's name was Yoko Ono
* The storylines mesh! I love it when that happens and is done well
